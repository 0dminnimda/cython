**PLEASE READ THIS FIRST:**
- DO NOT use the bug and feature tracker for general questions and support requests.
  Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.
  It has a wider audience, so you get more and better answers.
- Did you search for SIMILAR ISSUES already?
  Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.
- Did you try the LATEST MASTER BRANCH or pre-release?
  It might already have what you want to report.
  Specifically, the legacy stable 0.29.x release series receives only important low-risk bug fixes.
  Also see the Changelog regarding recent changes:
